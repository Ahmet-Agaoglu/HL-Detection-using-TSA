# HL-Detection-using-TSA
 This repository contains MATLAB code for a Horizon Line Detection algorithm utilizing dynamic ROI generation via Time Series Models (ARIMA and GARCH). The approach offers fast, accurate HL detection in maritime videos, focusing on dynamic environmental conditions and including mechanisms for error correction and ROI adjustment.
